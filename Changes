Revision history for Perl module Weather-OpenWeatherMap

0.005001 2015-12-29

  - Fix for potentially stale Request objects attached to cached Results

    A Request may have the same 'location =>' as the cached Result's
    '->request' object but different tags or other data.

    Cache->retrieve will now reattach the supplied Request to the returned
    cached Result.

  - Find->iter($count) now behaves like Forecast->iter($count)

  - Round off reported rain/snow totals for hourly report blocks; the
    precision returned by OpenWeatherMap is a bit ludicrous

  - Improve corrupted cache checks

  - Test suite fixes and cleanups
